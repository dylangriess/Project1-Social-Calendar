> As an adult living in Colorado, I would like to be able to create and save events and messages. I would also like to be able to see some delecious breweries, fun shows,  and other cool events that I could add to my shared calander. 


### API Usage

_____________________________________________


We used the following API's in this project:

1. Ticketmaster - This widget runs at the bottom of the screen and shows upcoming events in the Denver Area
2. Open Brewery - This application provides a list of breweries in Denver. We turned this into a random slector for the best user expereince.
