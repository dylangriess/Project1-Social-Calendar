##  Description 

_____________________________________________

__We have created a shared calander for the user to be able to:__.

 - Create an event for a day of the week. 
 - Find and see local events in Denver.
 - Find and visit local Breweries.
 - Save past events.


## User Story 

_____________________________________________

> As an adult living in Colorado, I would like to be able to create and save events and messages. I would also like to be able to see some delecious breweries, fun shows, and other cool events that I could add to my shared calander. There is an add Event section at the bottom for the user to save past events.  


### API Usage

_____________________________________________


We used the following API's in this project:

1. Ticketmaster - This widget runs at the bottom of the screen and shows upcoming events in the Denver Area
2. Open Brewery - This application provides a list of breweries in Denver. We turned this into a random slector for the best user expereince.
